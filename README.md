First, create a Personal Access Token for this repo

[How to](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

Save your github user info via the command line

[Check the "Your Identity" section](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

Save it via GitHub CLI (already installed on the google VMs, skip step 1)

"git clone (repository link)" in the gcloud terminal to copy onto the VM.
